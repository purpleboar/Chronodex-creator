# Chronodex creater

A Python script to automate the creation of diary which uses the Chronodex created by Patrick Ng 
(https://scription.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/scription-chronodex-weekly-planner-2012-free-download-with-the-cost-of-a-prayer.html) 

I have been using a variation on Patrick's Chronodex since 2012, by manaually editing the SVG files in preparation for the next year.
 I had always planned to try to automate it in some way, but with little programming experience I had always put it off. 
September 2021 roles around and I finally decided to give it a go.
This is a simple script that automates creation of the left and right pages of an A5 diary. It is still in development and not really for ready for general use. I have published on github to:


1. Gain sum familiarity with git and how to use it.
2. Give make it accessible if someone in the same situation as I was could benefit it.



Bear in mind, I am not a developer, this is not going to be pretty and there are probably better ways of doing practically everything. 

Be kind.
